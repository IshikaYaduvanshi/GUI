He wants the boy to go play outside, under the coolness of trees. \n I take cues from the hospice nurse:\n how she pinched the air where annoying invisible candles flickered in another patient’s room, extinguishing the unseen wicks. \n I’ve grasped the boy’s hand to lead him out, I say. \nI imagine the boy tugs on my arm in the entryway as his other hand reaches for the front door. Weary, I imagine a time when I don’t let go.''',
